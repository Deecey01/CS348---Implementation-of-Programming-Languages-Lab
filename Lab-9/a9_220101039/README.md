# Assignment 9 - Machine Independent Code Generator for microC

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine-independent code generator for the microC language, translating microC programs into three-address code (quad) representations. The implementation includes a lexer, parser, symbol table management, type checking, and quad array generation.

## Prerequisites
- GNU Make
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer)
- Bison (GNU Parser Generator)

## Files Included
1. `a9_220101039.l` - Flex lexer specification
2. `a9_220101039.y` - Bison parser specification with semantic actions
3. `symbol_table.[ch]` - Symbol table implementation
4. `quad_array.[ch]` - Quad array implementation
5. `type_check.[ch]` - Type checking and conversion
6. `translator.c` - Main driver program
7. `Makefile` - Build configuration

## Building the Project

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to build the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will:
   - Generate the lexer and parser from the Flex/Bison specifications
   - Compile all source files
   - Link the executable named `microc_translator`

## Running the Translator

### Basic Usage
```bash
./microc_translator <input_file.mc> [output_file.out]
```

- `<input_file.mc>`: Path to the microC source file to be translated
- `[output_file.out]`: Optional path for the output file (default prints to stdout)

### Example Command
```bash
./microc_translator 220101039_test.mc 220101039_quads.out
```

This will:
1. Parse the input file `220101039_test.mc`
2. Generate three-address code
3. Write the output to `220101039_quads.out` including:
   - Symbol tables
   - Generated quads
   - Any error messages

### Testing with Provided Test Cases
The Makefile includes a test target that runs the translator with a sample input file:
```bash
make test
```

## Output Format
The output file contains:
1. Parsing status message
2. Symbol table dump showing all symbols with their attributes
3. Quad array showing all generated three-address instructions

## Cleaning Up
To remove generated files and object files:
```bash
make clean
```

## Notes
1. The translator assumes the input microC file is lexically, syntactically, and semantically correct (no error handling).
2. The implementation supports a subset of microC as specified in the assignment document.
3. For debugging, you can examine the `parser.output` file generated by Bison (with the `-v` flag).

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter "command not found" errors, ensure Flex and Bison are installed
- If you get compilation errors about missing headers, verify all files are in the same directory
- For parser conflicts, check `parser.output` for detailed information

## Implementation Details
Key components include:
- Symbol table with nested scoping
- Quad array for three-address code generation
- Type checking and implicit conversion
- Backpatching for control flow statements
- Support for variables, arrays, pointers, and functions
